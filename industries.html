        YiShen Global does not operate by industry labels.
        We operate by structural similarity, risk profile,
        and system compatibility — starting from furniture.

  <!-- ================= CORE LOGIC ================= -->

    <div class="container narrow">

      <h2>Furniture Is the Core</h2>

      <p>
        Furniture supply chains sit at the intersection of
        product engineering, packaging survivability,
        compliance, manufacturing coordination, and delivery execution.
      </p >

      <p>
        Because of this complexity, furniture becomes the ideal
        core system from which adjacent industries can scale.

            Ergonomic chairs, task seating, standing desks,
            conference systems, and workspace solutions.
          </p >
          <p>
            High compliance sensitivity and long lifecycle requirements
            demand a system-driven approach.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Gaming & Performance Seating</h3>
          <p>
            Gaming chairs and performance seating
            require structural strength,
            brand differentiation, and e-commerce readiness.
