        YiShen Global does not sell isolated services.
        We design and operate integrated systems that

  <!-- ================= WHY SOLUTIONS ================= -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container narrow">

      <h2>Why Traditional Sourcing Fails</h2>

      <p>
        Most furniture sourcing problems are not caused by factories,
        materials, or even pricing.
      </p >

      <p>
        They fail because the system is fragmented:
        product decisions, packaging, compliance, manufacturing,
        and delivery are handled independently.
      </p >

      <p>
        YiShen Global solves this by engineering these elements
        into one controllable framework.
      </p >

  <!-- ================= SOLUTION MODULES ================= -->
  <section class="section bg-soft">
    <div class="container">

      <h2>Our Solution Modules</h2>

      <div class="grid-2 cards">

        <!-- Module 1 -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Product Structure Engineering</h3>
          <p>
            We define SKU architecture, component logic,
            material selection, and tolerance standards
            before production begins.
          </p >
          <p>
            This prevents downstream instability and
            uncontrolled variation across factories.
          </p >
        </div>

        <!-- Module 2 -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Packaging & Load Optimization</h3>
          <p>
            KD logic, carton structure, drop-risk mitigation,
            and container density are engineered as part of the product.
          </p >
          <p>
            This directly impacts landed cost, damage rate,
            and e-commerce viability.
          </p >
        </div>

        <!-- Module 3 -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Compliance Planning</h3>
          <p>
            BIFMA, EN1335, CE, UL and market-specific requirements
            are integrated early in the design stage.
          </p >
          <p>
            Compliance is treated as a pathway,
            not an emergency correction.
          </p >
        </div>

        <!-- Module 4 -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Manufacturing Coordination</h3>
          <p>
            We align the right factories by category,
            complexity, and risk profile.
          </p >
          <p>
            This avoids overloading single suppliers
            and reduces dependency risk.
          </p >
        </div>

        <!-- Module 5 -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Delivery Model Design</h3>
          <p>
            FOB, CIF, or DDP models are selected
            based on buyer structure, destination,
            and internal accountability.
          </p >
          <p>
            Responsibility is clearly defined
            across the delivery chain.
          </p >
        </div>

        <!-- Module 6 -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Program Ownership</h3>
          <p>
            YiShen Global operates as a single accountable system,
            not a collection of disconnected vendors.
          </p >
          <p>
            Buyers gain clarity, control, and repeatability.
          </p >

  <!-- ================= EXPANSION LOGIC ================= -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container narrow">

      <h2>Built for Expansion</h2>

      <p>
        While furniture is our core,
        this system is designed to scale across categories.
      </p >

      <ul class="logic-list">
        <li>Office & home furniture</li>
        <li>Ergonomic seating & desks</li>
        <li>Bamboo & wood products</li>
        <li>WPC flooring & panels</li>
        <li>Industrial & hardware categories</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        New categories plug into the same system
        without rebuilding the foundation.
      </p >

      <p>
        If you are evaluating solutions beyond price comparison,
        YiShen Global is designed for that level of sourcing.
