  <h1>Furniture-First Supply Chain Solutions</h1>
  <p>
    Solutions at YiShen are not SKUs, catalogs, or service packages.  
    They are engineered decision systems designed to reduce uncertainty
    across the full furniture procurement lifecycle.
  </p>

  <!-- SECTION -->
  <h2>What “Solutions” Means Here</h2>
  <p>
    We do not start from price, samples, or containers.  
    We start from engineering logic.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>SKU-level structural and tolerance validation</li>
    <li>Packaging survivability designed before production</li>
    <li>Cost predictability modeled before quotation</li>
    <li>Logistics routing engineered per market, not post-sale</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- FLOW -->
  <h2>Engineering Execution Flow</h2>
  <p>
    Every project follows a fixed engineering decision path.  
    No quotation before validation. No execution without predictability.
  </p>

  <h3>01 · Inquiry Intake</h3>
  <p>
    Product intent, target market, volume expectation, and risk boundaries
    are clarified before any technical discussion begins.
  </p>

  <h3>02 · Engineering Review</h3>
  <p>
    Structural logic, materials, tolerance stacking, and assembly feasibility
    are validated before quotation.
  </p>

  <h3>03 · Packaging & SOP Design</h3>
  <p>
    Drop-risk logic, carton structure, pallet rules, and warehouse SOP
    are engineered as part of the product system.
  </p>

  <h3>04 · Cost Predictability Modeling</h3>
  <p>
    BOM stability, logistics volatility, and currency exposure
    are modeled at SKU level to avoid future surprises.
  </p>

  <h3>05 · Logistics Architecture</h3>
  <p>
    FOB / CIF / DDP routing is engineered per market
    based on compliance, lead-time, and risk ownership.
  </p>

  <h3>06 · Execution & Delivery</h3>
  <p>
    Production, inspection, loading, and delivery
    follow predefined SOP with timeline transparency.
  </p>

  <!-- WHAT WE DON'T DO -->

  <ul>
    <li>No trading-style price guessing</li>
    <li>No blind OEM without system control</li>

  </ul>

  <!-- SCOPE -->
  <h2>Solution Scope</h2>
  <p>
    The system is designed to scale beyond furniture
    without breaking the architecture.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Office seating & ergonomic systems</li>
    <li>Functional sofas & compressed packaging</li>
    <li>Bamboo & wood furniture systems</li>
    <li>WPC flooring systems</li>
    <li>Chain & rigging hardware</li>
    <li>Industrial project cargo</li>
  </ul>
