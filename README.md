# 🚀 YiShen Global Website Project - V31.0: Content Architecture

This project repository contains the static HTML/CSS/JS files for the YiShen Global corporate website. The V31.0 iteration marks a strategic shift to an "Engineered Supply Chain" positioning, emphasizing technical data, compliance, and predictable B2B logistics.

**Current Status:** CODE FREEZE (Content Integration Phase - The Life-or-Death Battle)

---

## 📌 1. Project Stack & Architecture

* **Type:** Static HTML/CSS/JS (Lightweight, fast, secure)
* **Aesthetics:** Engineering Aesthetic (Dark Mode / Tech Blue Accent)
* **CSS Framework:** Custom CSS based on modern Flexbox/Grid architecture (Master file: `styles.css`).
* **Key Dependencies:** Font Awesome 6 (for all icons) and Google Fonts (Inter).

## 2. Strategic Site Map (Core Files)

| File Name | Description | Key Strategic Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `index.html` | Homepage | **Brand Gateway.** Focus on Engineering Lab, key stats, and immediate CTA. |
| `why-us.html` | Why Us | **Trust Builder.** Focus on QC, BIFMA testing, and vertical integration process. (Content PENDING) |
| `solutions.html` | Solutions | **Service Matrix.** Detailed breakdown of DTC, B2B, and Project Cargo logistics. (Content PENDING) |
| `industries.html` | Industries | **Sector Authority.** High-level English positioning for target B2B segments. |
| `resources.html` | Technical Data Hub | **Data Transparency.** Overview of 20+ SKU data pools and download links. |
| `sku-detail.html` | SKU Detail Template | **Conversion Tool.** Template for tables showing 40'HQ load, material specs, etc. **REQUIRES DATA FILL.** |
| `contact.html` | Contact | **Conversion Funnel.** Comprehensive contact options (Dual WhatsApp, Emails, Socials). |
| `styles.css` | Stylesheet | **V31.0 Master.** Contains all styling, media queries, and mobile interaction fixes. |
| `script.js` | JavaScript | Controls mobile menu navigation only (deliberately minimal). |

## 3. ⚠️ CODE FREEZE Directives (Mandatory)

**DO NOT** add new features, CSS animations, or complex JavaScript at this stage. All resources must be focused on the **Content Integration Battle.**

| Task Focus | Action Required | Responsible Team | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **VISUALS (Highest Priority)** | Replace all placeholder images with professional **A-Hero** and **B-Nano-Detail** photos/CGI. | Photography/CGI Team | PENDING |
| **DATA INTEGRATION** | Fill `sku-detail.html` and the tables on `resources.html` with real, verified engineering data (esp. **40'HQ Load Qty**). | Engineering/Data Team | PENDING |
| **TEXT CONTENT** | Write professional English content for the placeholder sections in `why-us.html` and `solutions.html`. | Marketing/Copywriting Team | PENDING |

## 4. Maintenance & Deployment Notes

* **Mobile Fixes:** Mobile interaction is handled entirely via CSS `@media (hover: none)` queries in `styles.css` to ensure smooth experience without heavy JS reliance.
* **Architecture:** The minimal use of `script.js` is a deliberate design choice for site speed and stability.
* **Contact:** Features Dual WhatsApp links for increased client reach and security.
