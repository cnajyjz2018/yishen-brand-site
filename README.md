YiShen Global
Furniture-First · AI-Driven Global Supply Chain System

Predictability is engineered — not promised.
YiShen Global is an engineering-first furniture supply system combining AI, manufacturing, compliance, packaging, and global delivery into one controllable workflow.

🌍 Overview

YiShen Global is not a traditional trading website.

It is a Furniture-First, AI-Driven International Business System designed to help global buyers, distributors, brands, and project contractors source furniture with predictability, not uncertainty.

We integrate:

Furniture manufacturing (OEM / ODM)

Engineering & compliance logic

Packaging survivability modeling

DDP / FOB / CIF execution

AI-assisted sales, marketing, and follow-up systems

This repository contains the front-end execution layer of that system.

🪑 Core Product Focus (Furniture-First)

YiShen Global is furniture-led by design, not a generic supply chain site.

Primary Categories

Ergonomic / Mesh Office Chairs

Gaming Chairs

Standing Desks

Sofa & Lounge Seating

Project / Contract Furniture

All pages, logic, and conversion flows are built around furniture decision-making, not SKU dumping.
