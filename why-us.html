  <!-- ================= CORE LOGIC ================= -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container narrow">

      <h2>1. The Real Problem We Solve</h2>
      <p>
        Most failures in global furniture sourcing are not caused by
        product quality.
      </p >
      <p>
        They are caused by <strong>system instability</strong>:
        inconsistent lead time, unclear responsibility,
        packaging failures, compliance surprises, and poor communication
        between factory, logistics, and buyer.
      </p >
      <p>
        YiShen Global exists to engineer stability into this system.

  <section class="section bg-soft">
    <div class="container narrow">

      <h2>2. Our Engineering Principles</h2>

      <ul class="logic-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Furniture-first design</strong><br>
          Every decision starts from furniture structure, materials,
          packaging survivability, and end-use environment.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Process before price</strong><br>
          Price without process control only creates downstream risk.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Responsibility clarity</strong><br>
          Each step has an owner: design, production, packing,
          loading, clearance, delivery.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Predictability over promises</strong><br>
          We engineer lead time, not explain delays.
        </li>
      </ul>
