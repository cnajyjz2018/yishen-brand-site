    <h1>Why YiShen Global</h1>

      Built as a supply system — not a trading shortcut.

<!-- ================= CORE LOGIC ================= -->
<section class="section">
  <div class="container">

    <div class="logic-block">
      <h2>1. Engineering Comes First</h2>
      <p>
        YiShen Global does not start with pricing or volume.
        We start with engineering structure — product logic,
        packaging survivability, compliance alignment, and
        delivery feasibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach reduces downstream risk before orders
        are placed.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="logic-block">
      <h2>2. Systems Over Individuals</h2>
      <p>
        Our delivery capability does not depend on a single
        salesperson or factory contact.
        Processes are documented, repeatable, and transferable.
      </p>
      <p>
        This allows buyers to scale programs without rebuilding
        trust each time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="logic-block">
      <h2>3. Predictability Is Designed</h2>
      <p>
        Lead time, packaging integrity, and landed cost
        are engineered variables — not promises.
      </p>
      <p>
        We design for predictability because instability
        costs more than unit price differences.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="logic-block">
      <h2>4. Built for Internal Approval</h2>
      <p>
        Our documentation, structure, and communication
        are designed to survive internal reviews:
        procurement, engineering, compliance, and finance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This shortens decision cycles for professional buyers.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="logic-block">
      <h2>5. Long-Term Compatibility</h2>
      <p>
        YiShen Global is designed for ongoing programs,
        not one-off transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        OEM, ODM, and private-label cooperation are supported
        by system-level thinking rather than ad-hoc execution.
      </p>
    </div>

<!-- ================= DECISION NOTE ================= -->
<section class="section section-muted">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
    <p>
      YiShen Global works best with buyers who value
      system stability, engineering discipline, and
      scalable cooperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      If sourcing is treated as a long-term system rather
      than a short-term price exercise, we align well.
